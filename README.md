# SeroSurveillance

----

This is a reproducible workflow in R for the standardization of ELISA reads across plates, following [K. Miura et al. 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2253722/).

----

## Method

From Template matrix in Excel, Reference Serum on each plate was fitted to a four-parameters log-logistic model in order to estimate arbitrary Antibody Units of each unknown sample per plate.
