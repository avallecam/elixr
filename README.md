# SeroSurveillance

----

This is a reproducible workflow in R for the standardization of ELISA reads across plates, after following [K. Miura et al. 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2253722/) experimental procedure.

----

## Method

From Template matrix in excel format, reference serum on each plate was fitted to four-parameters log-logistic models in order to estimate the arbitrary Antibody Units of each unknown sample per plate.
